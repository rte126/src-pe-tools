/** Filter that redirects all requests sent to blah.jsp to blah.faces.
 *  Fixes the very annoying error messages you get if you access
 *  JSF pages with .jsp extensions. However, this filter assumes three things:
 *  <UL>
 *    <LI>The extension is .faces. You can change this in web.xml, but this
 *        code will not pick up the change automatically.
 *        (TODO: can the extension be determined automatically?)
 *    <LI>You have no non-JSF JSP pages that you want to access with .jsp extensions.
 *    <LI>The welcome-file name is index.jsp. If the URL ends with / and the system
 *        forwards to a .jsp page, the filter is invoked but is not told
 *        the file name.
 *  </UL>
 *  See <A HREF="http://www.coreservlets.com/JSF-Tutorial">
 *  the coreservlets.com JSF tutorial</A>.
